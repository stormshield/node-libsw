# ⛔️ ARCHIVED libsw

This is a simple client library for Scrumwise API.

The official documentation is available [here](https://www.scrumwise.com/api.html)

## Usage

`npm install -S @stormshield/libsw`

The library offers some operations on different resources e.g. backlog items, sprints, tags, etc.

Every operation takes an `opts` object that must have at least two fields for authentication purpose: `email` and `apikey`.

The API key must be generated by an administrator in Scrumwise settings. The email address can be yours and it will identify you as the initiator of the actions that you will perform through the API.
